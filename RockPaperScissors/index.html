    <!--I decided to use ID's for 'computer-choice', 'user-choice' and 'results' as getElementById returns a single DOM element whose ID matches your query.
    However, getElementsByClassName returns an HtmlCollection - an array-like structure containing the DOM elements that matched your query. To not have to index this array,
    I stuck to single-element ID's :). I used classes for others as those are generally static elements that are being modified by CSS. -->
